## Git Workflow

 **Fork the Repository**

1\. On Github's website, navigate to the repository for [Arrays](https://github.com/MauriceOkumu/ArraysForMoseAndKibugi)  
2\. Click the "Fork" button near the top right part of the screen.  
3\. In the popup box, select your Github profile to copy the repository from the TelegraphPrep Github profile to your   profile.

 **Clone the Repository**

### Goals

As is, the repository is missing code for most of the functions. It's your job to fix the library by implementing the functions. In this section, the functions have to do with Arrays and their use in Javascript.

Your goal is to get all the tests to pass by implementing the missing functions. Run all the tests by opening `SpecRunner.html` in your browser.

The file `src/arrays.js` contains function definitions and is where you will add your code.

The files in the `spec` and `lib` directories contain the test suites. You don't need to modify these files.

Use arrayTests.js to guide you in implementing the functions.

Refresh the webpage after implementing a function to see if the test is passing
